# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis
Introduction

Understanding customer behavior through RFM analysis is pivotal for effective marketing and CRM strategies in online retail. This study explores RFM analysis and binning techniques such as equal width and equal frequency binning to uncover distinct customer groups and purchasing patterns. The study further investigates associations and variances using statistical analyses.

Methodology

The methodology involves several key steps: data collection, preprocessing, RFM metrics calculation, and customer segmentation using binning techniques.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   
The dataset comprises detailed transactional data from an online retail store. Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing inconsistencies like negative quantities or prices, ensuring data integrity.

2. RFM Metrics Calculation
   
The RFM analysis uses three key metrics:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase
Frequency: How often purchases were made
Monetary: The total amount spent
This study applied RFM analysis to categorize customers into distinct segments, aiding in personalized marketing strategies.

3. Equal Width Binning
   
Equal width binning divides RFM metrics into five equal-width bins to facilitate easier segmentation. The values are categorized into bins ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) for each metric: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.

4. Equal Frequency Binning
   
Equal frequency binning divides the metrics into five equal-sized groups. It helps create meaningful customer segments, enabling comparison and targeted marketing strategies.

5. Chi-Squared Analysis
   
The chi-squared test was used to examine the association between Recency and both Monetary and Frequency bins. This analysis determines whether significant differences exist between the bins.

6. ANOVA Analysis
   
ANOVA tests assessed disparities in means across distinct Recency, Frequency, and Monetary bin levels. These tests provided insights into customer behavior across different segments.

Conclusion

The study demonstrates the effectiveness of RFM analysis for customer segmentation in online retail. Binning techniques and statistical analyses reveal distinct customer groups, aiding in formulating targeted marketing strategies.
